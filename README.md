My name is `Ed` and these are my `tools`. Get it? `tool`+`ed` = `tooled`.

This repository contains my custom python methods I've developed over my Ph.D school days. There is no unifying theme as I've worked on a little of little and big things. I will try to keep things organized in modules. So for exaple image operations should all be under `image`.

| Module name | Purpose |
| :---: | :---: |
| kip | KNIME Image processing tools for parsing and graphing data from KNIME |
| image | Image analysis operations (_e.g._ `find_blobs()`) |
